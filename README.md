## Product Vision
> For newly arrived refugees who wants to learn Swedish words, the SvenScan is a language teaching application, that by the use of augmented reality helps with teaching words encountered in user’s everyday life. Unlike learning from written words, our product lets the user listen to the words pronunciation and track the user’s learning progress.
